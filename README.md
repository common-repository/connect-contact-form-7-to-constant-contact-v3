This will connect Contact form 7 (or WooCommerce Checkou) to Constant Contact using the Constant Contact API V3. Requires an API Key and Secret for functionality to work.  Allows use of checkbox, all lists, and updates existing records.

== Description ==

This is an advanced Constant Contact to Contact Form 7 Connector. This plug-in will allow you to make a connection to Constant Contact's API using OAUTH protocol.  Retrieve all of your contact lists, and allow users to sign up for a single list, or multiple lists.  This will update existing contacts in your Constant Contact list, or add new if they don't exist.  In addition to adding or updating E-Mail addresses of contacts in your list, this will also allow you to push basic contact fields, including:

*   First Name
*   Last Name
*   Full Address Information including Country

Some uses for this plugin would be to add an optional checkbox to a regular contact form where users can subscribe to a single or multiple CTCT lists.  You could also include this with a product registration form, or pretty much make every form on your website a possibility for users to subscribe to your Constant Contact Lists.

### Additional Features
* Spam Prevention - Submitted e-mail addresses are subjected to a domain verification script, before they're submitted to Constant Contact.  This helps keep your contact list cleaner.
* Failsafe Methods- In the event that Constant Contact's API is down, the plugin will store failed attempts and retry twice daily until they are successfully added.
* Error Reporting - If email addresses are submitted and rejected, an email is sent to the admin. Admin will be informed of users who may have unsubscribed previously and other constant contact error codes.
* Authentication Failure Notification - in the event that the authorization to constant contact is lost, the admin will get a notification to re-authorize the application.

There will be a pro version available that can connect with any available Constant Contact field, including custom fields that you've defined in your Constant Contact account.
